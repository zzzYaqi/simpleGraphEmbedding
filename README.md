# simpleGraphEmbedding

This a project focused on graph embedding, featuring a custom-crafted dataset and exploring two key applications: Link Prediction and Clustering.

The project implements a dataset crafted by myself, 2 applications of graph embedding: Link Prediction and Clustering, 3 basic graph embedding algorithms: Deepwalk, Node2Vec and Spectral Embedding, and a website showcasing visualization techniques like interactive graphs and animations using D3.js, along with result figures using Echarts.

The initial idea is that I would like to see what my social network within video games looks like and if there's any hidden information in it. Maybe I can find unknown connections among friends or predict the game preferences my friends may have. So I collected their taste in 36 video games and generated 2 graphs based on particular rules.

With the graphs ready, it's time to explore which algorithms best suit these datasets. Finished some research and applied the algorithms with different parameters aiming to find the optimal approaches. Also, it's worth thinking about how to visualize those data and analytic results.

In the last step, I built the website. Here is how it looks:
